I have developed an informative Web-App for the SPFL which acts as a front for the SPFL
(Scottish Professional Football League)official website, the user will be able to find information
on the SPFL, a brief history, the user will be able to find up to date information as well as
current league standings on all 42 clubs in the SPFL system, as well as latest media from YouTube and Twitter posts.
The user will need a to be connected to the Internet to use the app as the app has external links for all clubs.

The reason I chose the SPFL clubs is because I have a passion for Scottish Football and I would actually use this Web-App.
if this was on my computer and for instance I was looking to see team news for my favourite team or check the fixtures
without going to other news broadcasters. If this Web-App was in to be saved in my favourites I would most likely
use it 2-3 times a week. I also think other people would use it if it was further developed for a mobile or tablet app.

The purpose of this Web-App is to inform supporters of Scottish Football on everything going on in their club and rivals, from Youtube Videos to league positions
on all of the teams. This could be used by loads of people from people tracking form for betting to journalists looking to make a match pre match report,
analysing any given teams form simply by clicking on the teams badge. I'm aware that people interested in teams could simply visit the SPFL page themselves,
however having a Web-App that has everything at one click would be a handy short cut for anyone on their machine.

Enhancements
I would love to make this a mobile app and make it available for ipads and tablets, once I learn more about the Linux environment, so that I can make it mobile friendly,
and if there was a more effective way to create the league table instead of having tables, and having to edit the data every week, but I dont think theres anyway of changing
the way that is done. But I will look into it, once I have more time to develop it further, I believe there is a market for an app like this and think it would be worth looking
into marketing this app or creating another similar without using SPFL elements.

Design

I created this Web-App by following tutorials online and from the workbook that was giving to me, it gave me the basics of how to make a Web-App
using Python Flask and doing so using the Linux terminal, navigation from page to page is done using flask code that I learned on the tutorials,  I used HTML code to 
link elements for external websites such as Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and the SPFL website. I also used HTML to create the pages on the app that have 
tables for keeping information. I used tables for the teams page, to hold the club badges, these hold the teams logo and their teams name. once clicked
the user will be taken to a new tab in which they will find detailed information on the the team they have chosen. The user will also be able to navigate to any team if
they know the URL, for example if the user was to visit Queens Park the third division team they could use http://localhost:5000/queens_park/ and it will take them to 
the SPFL.co.uk/queens-park/ page. All Routing URLs will be supplied in the readme.txt file.

The Web-App is simple as its not big in size and wont take long to run, it was tested on two computers windows computers running different operating systems, my personal
machine runs windows 10 with browsers- Internet Explorer and Google Chrome, the app worked perfectly on that and the JKCC computers which run on windows7 enterprise edition.
The testing method I used what Alpha testing, I tested the Web-App while I was working my way through and when I was finished the only problems that I was having was 
spelling errors on variables or typos,  When I was satisfied I ran beta testing and asked my flat mate an experienced web user, who gave me positive feedback but suggested
that I put the team names under the badges in the teams page, which was something I agreed with and it looks better with it.

Critical Reflection

The Web-App has a basic style, I chose to make it with a basic bootstrap template because has good accessibility and can be used by users of any level of computing
knowledge, I did make one small design change and it was to add a golden underline on the nav-bar which for a small touch shows a bit of class, as gold is often
the colour of champions and its a competitive sport so that is good edit for how small it is. The user should feel that it was professionally done, given the Web-App
is layed out in a simple way with no loading time between screens, and very little time before redirecting to the SPFL website. The Web-App has very little interactivity
however the user can contact the SPFL via Twitter on the media page, as well as flicking through videos that are on the YouTube feed, theres small things done on the pages
that give the user feedback which could be better, things like the rollover and changing size of the Facebook, Twitter and Youtube image links on the home page. On the teams page
when the user rolls over any club badge, it makes the logo bigger to give user feedback that the object is in fact something that they can click on, also if they look to the 
bottom left of their page they will see that clicking these objects will re-direct them to another page, when the images are enlarged it puts the table structure and 
all the team badges move, I wish I could fix this and I would say its the biggest visible flaw the Web-App has.
I added colour to the league tables on the standing page, this also gives the user an idea of what happens with the leagues after all matches are played, there is information there for it
but without looking the colours on the team position gives them the idea, dark green is automatic promotion, light green is play offs for promotion, dark red is automatic relegation, lighter red
is relegation play off place and Dark Gold is Champion with the lighter colours for runners up means they have qualified for European Competition.

Personal Reflection

Personally I feel more used to the Linux terminal however I still feel that I'm a basic user, it is a took that excites me as I learn to become a web developer, learning this
environment will only help me achieve that, I have learned a lot in a short space of time to be able to complete the Web-App, I started late due to problems with my CW1
but I was satisfied on completion, I learned how to create a simple Web-App using Bootstrap css, which I then could adapt to suit, learning funcitons on with Flask, 
as well as importing and working with CSS and HTML. However the challenges I faced and which I couldn't find a way to fix were hosting images locally on the app, tried following
a tutorial online at an early stage of creating the app, all the images that are on the Web-App are hosted online that is how I got over that challenge. 
I found a difficult challenge when routing my Web-App's URLS, I wanted the user to be able to enter the team the wanted by going to the address bar and typing for example
https://localhost:5000/teams/queens_park/ I looked online for a tutorial for something that would automatically redirect me to the spfl.co.uk/queens-park/ page, I tried following
examples on stackoverflow.com among other tutorials, I couldn't find a way to do it using Flask, my alternative was to use HTML redirect it, this process took me two nights trying
to come up with a way to do it, although its not using Flask code to redirect me, I'm satisfied that the routing is working.
